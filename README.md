## Prop Betting Machine Learning Project
### Overview
### This project is designed to predict player performance for prop betting using machine learning models. It pulls data from various sources, processes it, and then uses predictive algorithms to help identify potential prop bets with favorable odds.
### The project focuses primarily on NBA player performance (though it could be extended to other sports) and leverages historical game data, player statistics, and matchup details to create predictions.
## Key Features
### Data Collection: Automatically collects player statistics and game data from online sources.
### Feature Engineering: Processes raw data to create features such as pace, defensive ratings, and team matchups.
### Machine Learning Models: Implements multiple machine learning algorithms to predict player outcomes (e.g., points, rebounds, assists).
### Evaluation: Compares model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared values.
### Prop Finder: Identifies favorable betting opportunities based on predictions compared to sportsbook lines.
