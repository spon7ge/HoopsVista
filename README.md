## Prop Betting Machine Learning Project
### Overview
### This project is designed to predict player performance for prop betting using machine learning models. It pulls data from various sources, processes it, and then uses predictive algorithms to help identify potential prop bets with favorable odds.
### The project focuses primarily on NBA player performance (though it could be extended to other sports) and leverages historical game data, player statistics, and matchup details to create predictions.
