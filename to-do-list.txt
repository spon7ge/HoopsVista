  **Adding Section: Real-time Data Updates and Model Retraining**

  ---
  
  To ensure your models are up-to-date with the latest player information, we'll add a section dedicated to gathering data of upcoming players a few hours before the games start. This will allow you to feed new data into your existing dataset and retrain your models to improve prediction accuracy.
  
  ---
  
  ### **8. Real-time Data Updates and Model Retraining**
  
  **Objective:** Automate the process of collecting new player data before games, updating the dataset, and retraining the models with the latest information.
  
  #### **Steps:**
  
  - **8.1 Schedule Automated Data Collection**
    - Set up a scheduled task to fetch the latest player data a few hours before game time.
  
  - **8.2 Update Dataset with New Data**
    - Integrate the newly collected data into your existing dataset without duplications.
  
  - **8.3 Retrain Models with Updated Data**
    - Retrain or incrementally update your models to incorporate the new data.
  
  - **8.4 Deploy Updated Models**
    - Replace the old models in your backend with the newly trained models.
  
  #### **Cursor Prompts:**
  
  - **8.1 Scheduling Automated Data Collection**
  
    ```
    Generate a Python script that:
    - Connects to the NBA Stats API (or relevant data source).
    - Fetches data for upcoming players and games scheduled for the day.
    - Collects player stats, prop lines, and any recent performance data.
    - Saves this data into a CSV file named `upcoming_player_data.csv`.
  
    Additionally, set up a scheduled task (using cron for Unix or Task Scheduler for Windows) to run this script daily at a specified time (e.g., 2 PM EST).
    ```
  
  - **8.2 Updating the Existing Dataset**
  
    ```
    Write a Python function that:
    - Loads the existing dataset (e.g., `combined_seasons_df.csv`).
    - Loads the new data from `upcoming_player_data.csv`.
    - Checks for and removes any duplicate entries.
    - Appends the new data to the existing dataset.
    - Saves the updated dataset back to `combined_seasons_df.csv`.
    Ensure that the dataset maintains the correct format and data types.
    ```
  
  - **8.3 Retraining the Models with New Data**
  
    ```
    Modify the model training script to:
    - Accept an updated dataset as input.
    - Retrain the models (Random Forest, XGBoost) using the combined data.
    - Save the retrained models with a timestamped filename (e.g., `points_model_YYYYMMDD.pkl`).
  
    Implement logic to compare the performance of the new models with the old ones using a validation set. Only deploy the new models if they show improved or at least consistent performance.
    ```
  
  - **8.4 Automating Model Retraining and Deployment**
  
    ```
    Create a master script called `update_models.py` that:
    - Calls the data collection script.
    - Updates the dataset with the new data.
    - Retrains the models.
    - Validates model performance.
    - Replaces the old models in the Django backend if the new models pass validation.
  
    Set up this script to run automatically after the data collection script, ensuring the entire pipeline from data collection to deployment is automated.
    ```
  
  - **8.5 Backend Model Update Handling**
  
    ```
    In the Django backend, modify the code that loads the models to:
    - Always load the latest model file based on the timestamp in the filename.
    - Implement a fallback mechanism to use the previous model if the latest one fails to load.
  
    Ensure that the backend does not experience downtime during model updates by handling model loading exceptions gracefully.
    ```
  
  - **8.6 Logging and Notification**
  
    ```
    Enhance the `update_models.py` script to:
    - Log each step of the process (data collection, dataset update, model training, deployment).
    - Send a notification (e.g., email or Slack message) upon successful model update or if any errors occur during the process.
  
    Use Python's `logging` library and integrate with a notification service or API.
    ```

  **Additional Cursor Prompts for Enhanced Functionality**
  
  - **8.7 Incremental Learning (Optional)**
  
    ```
    If retraining the entire model daily is time-consuming, implement incremental learning. Write code to update the existing models with new data without retraining from scratch. Use algorithms that support partial fitting, such as `sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor` for linear models or explore online learning methods.
    ```
  
  - **8.8 Real-time Data Streaming (Advanced)**
  
    ```
    For advanced functionality, set up a real-time data streaming pipeline using tools like Apache Kafka or AWS Kinesis. Write code to consume data streams of player stats and prop lines, and update the models in near real-time.
  
    This would involve significant architectural changes and is recommended only if real-time predictions are critical for your application.
