## To-Do list
- player game logs
    - for the last two seasons '2022-23' and '2023-24'
    - future proof it, be able to update it with most recent games(make a function to update players and year)
    - Basic boxscore stats
- player adv stats
    - PER, USG%, TS%, eFG%, WS, BPM, ORTG, DRTG
- contextual and situational stats
    - Home/Away
    - Rest days
    - Game Pace
    - Team Role/ Rotation
- Recent Performance Trend
    - Last 5-10 Game Averages
    - Consistency Metrics
    - Injury Reports
- Team Context
    - Team offensive rating/ Team Defensive rating
    - Team Pace

Example of Important Features for Predicting Points:
Historical Points per Game (PPG): A player's scoring average in previous games.
Field Goal Attempts (FGA) and Field Goal Percentage (FG%): Higher attempts and better efficiency usually lead to more points.
Usage Rate (USG%): Indicates the player's involvement in the offense.
Three-Point Attempts (3PA) and Three-Point Percentage (3P%): Essential for players who rely on three-point shooting.
Free Throw Attempts (FTA) and Free Throw Percentage (FT%): Indicates how often a player gets to the line and how efficiently they score there.
Opponent Defense Rating: How strong the opponent's defense is, especially against the player's position.


Additional Considerations
Correlation Analysis: Perform a correlation analysis between these stats and the target variable (e.g., points, rebounds) to identify which features have the strongest relationship with the outcome you're predicting.
Feature Selection and Importance: Use machine learning techniques like feature importance in decision trees or SHAP values in more complex models to determine the most predictive features.
